# COVID-19 Data Science Project: Do Diverse Cities Have Higher COVID-19 Mortality? 

## Research Question

What is the relationship between the racial backgrounds and urbanization levels of western and eastern states, and what is their effect on COVID-19 mortality rates in the USA?


## Overview

This data science project investigates the relationship between racial demographics, urbanization levels, and COVID-19 death rates across different U.S. counties. The goal is to analyze whether factors like race and urbanization correlate with higher COVID-19 mortality rates and to provide insights that can inform future health interventions.

## Key Insights

- **Demographic Analysis**: Explored correlations between the racial composition of counties and COVID-19 death rates.
- **Urbanization Impact**: Analyzed how urbanization levels affect COVID-19 outcomes across states.
- **Geospatial Mapping**: Used geospatial data to visualize and compare coastal regions (East vs. West) in terms of COVID-19 impact.
- **Statistical Methods**: Applied linear regression and exploratory data analysis (EDA) techniques to uncover significant patterns.

## Methodology

1. **Data Cleaning**: Pre-processed county-level COVID-19 data and demographic information.
2. **Visualization**: Created informative graphs and maps to illustrate trends.
3. **Analysis**: Focused on correlations and urbanization impact using linear regression.
4. **Geospatial Mapping**: Visualized differences in COVID-19 rates across coastal regions.

## Tools & Technologies

- **Python**: For data analysis, cleaning, and visualization.
- **Libraries**:
  - pandas, matplotlib, seaborn for data manipulation and visualization.
  - geopandas, plotly for geospatial analysis and mapping.
- **Jupyter Notebook**: For documenting the project and interactive analysis.

## Results

- No strong trends emerged between urbanization and COVID-19 death rates.
- Some correlations between racial demographics and COVID-19 mortality rates, but additional factors (e.g., healthcare access) may play a stronger role.
- The analysis suggests that government responses to healthcare crises should consider racial and urbanization factors.

## Future Work

- Incorporate additional confounding variables (e.g., healthcare access, vaccination rates) for a more robust analysis.
- Perform a deeper geospatial analysis to identify regional health disparities.
