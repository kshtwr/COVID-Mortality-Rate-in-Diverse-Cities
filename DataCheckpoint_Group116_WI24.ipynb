    "\n",
    "During the COVID-19 pandemic, several analyses determined that people of color (POC) were experiencing a disproportionately larger COVID-19 mortality rate than Caucasians, including one report by Elisabeth Gawthrop at the APM Research Lab (Gawthrop). Her report used state-reported data from the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). She then normalized the data by age per the recommendation of the CDC, which stated that the effect of age should be accounted for since multiple variables such as the risk of infection and hospitalization rates differ by age (CDC). Using age-normalized data, she determined that as of September 27 of 2023, the COVID-19 mortality rate for Black individuals was around 55% higher than the rate for Caucasian individuals. The mortality rate for Latinos was nearly 65% higher than Caucasians (Gawthrop). \n",
    "\n",
    "These previous studies have presented the apparent relationship between racial background and COVID-19 mortality rates. As a result, we now wish to determine how this relationship interacts with other possible variables. Thus, the three variables we will focus on are: racial background, the level of urbanization in counties (operationalized by Urban Rural Codes), and COVID-19 mortality rates. Existing literature qualifies the existence of social discrepancy in COVID mortality rates through its exploration with different racial populations. To add to this, our research aims to investigate whether or not that discrepancy is actually socio-economic in nature or not. Moreover, investigating distinct regions (easter and western states) enables a more cogent understanding of a possible socio-economic dimension by introducing greater within-sample variability without harming the validity of the analysis. Therefore, we predict that urban areas with a larger population of racial minorities will have the highest COVID-19 mortality rates. In comparison, rural areas with a smaller population of racial minorities will have the lowest COVID-19 mortality rates.\n",

    "# Hypothesis\n",
    "\n",
    "We predict that areas with a higher urbanization level will have higher COVID-19 mortality rates. Within the confined spaces of an urban region, there are more opportunities for the uninfected population to make contact with COVID-19 infected individuals. We also predict that areas with a larger population of racial minorities will have higher COVID-19 mortality rates, since these communities often have less resources available and may find it more difficult to treat every infected patient optimally. Combining our previous predictions, we predict that urban areas with a larger population of racial minorities will have the highest COVID-19 mortality rates, while rural areas with a smaller population of racial minorities will have the lowest COVID-19 mortality rates."

    "The data we will be using to answer our question is: Provisional COVID 19 Deaths by County and Race and Hispanic Origin. This dataset has about 3700 observations, with the following features such as urbanization, county, state, racial background proportions for most races, COVID-19 deaths, total deaths, and date. This dataset contains everything we need to answer our research question barring missing data on some races due to privacy which will be accounted for in our final analysis. However, this dataset is not our ideal dataset as it does not give data that is over a period of time but rather a total over the time period of January 2020 up to September 2023. This may create some misinterpretation as some counties may have initially handled COVID-19 poorly but are now handling it well and vice versa. \n",

    "To get the data into a usable format, we first had to keep only the parts of the data that were deaths specific to COVID, as the data also included non-COVID deaths. Based on our research question, we wanted to analyze states on the east and west coast. So, we only kept the remaining data that were for counties in east and west coast states. Then, we had to analyze which parts of the data were missing. Even though there were columns for specific ethnicities such as American Indian or Native Hawaiian, a lot of counties had missing information for these columns and only had data for few columns Non-Hispanic Whites and Non-Hispanic Blacks and NaN for others. In order to standardize the data, while still having a decent number of obvservations, we decided to see how many counties had data for Non-Hispanic Whites, Non-Hispanic Blacks, Non-Hispanic Asians, and Hispanics, which was 170, and removed those which didn’t. Then, we added essentially a column that was for the proportion of the population not in those ethnicities (the remainder/other column basically). Finally, we dropped a lot of columns which were unnecessary to our data, such as codes for counties and states (which do not provide as easily understandable info as county names and state names) and date-range, which was standard across the whole data set (1/2020 to 9/2023). We also removed total deaths, as we only cared about COVID-19 deaths."

Some counties have information for every ethnicity, while others have missing data for one ethnicity only or for many ethnicities. Taking a look at the data, at least a significant number of counties had information for Non-Hispanic White, Black and Asians and Hispanics, which we felt was strong enough to analyze racial data trends for these counties. Thus we kept counties which had information for these categories and added one which were all ethnicities outside of these."

These concerns make the urbanization level of cities an imperative variable to consider to avoid biases or confounding variables. Lastly, to minimize inaccuracies within our data analysis, our group looks at the relationship between eastern and western states over a long period of time (2020-2023) rather than focusing at one point of time.

If all the parts are taken, we plan on having one or two people look over the entire project or step in when help is needed in the coding or writing parts of the project. \n",
